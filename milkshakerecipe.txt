[200~Classic Vanilla Milkshake
Ingredients:
2 cups vanilla ice cream
1 cup milk (whole milk works best for a creamy texture)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, for extra flavor)
Whipped cream (optional, for topping)
Maraschino cherry (optional, for garnish)
Instructions:
Blend Ingredients: In a blender, combine the vanilla ice cream, milk, and vanilla extract if using. Blend on high until smooth and creamy. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the blender to ensure everything is well mixed.
Adjust Consistency: If the milkshake is too thick, add a little more milk and blend again until you reach your desired consistency. If itâ€™s too thin, add more ice cream and blend again.
Serve: Pour the milkshake into a tall glass.
Garnish: Top with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry if desired.
Enjoy: Grab a straw and enjoy your delicious milkshake!
Feel free to get creative by adding flavors or mix-ins, like chocolate syrup, fresh fruit, or candy pieces!
